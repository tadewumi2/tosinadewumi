                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I’ve had quite the journey—from studying English Literature in my undergraduate days to becoming a web developer in the making! As an international student in Canada, I’ve embraced learning and adapting to new environments, finding joy in every challenge and milestone.</p>

                <h2>My Teaching and Volunteering</h2>
                <p>With over 8 years of teaching experience, I’ve mastered the art of breaking down complex ideas—an invaluable skill in tech. I’ve volunteered at tech workshops and once served as a judge at a UNESCO-recognized spelling competition. Through these experiences, I’ve discovered my love for helping others grow, whether it’s by mentoring, creating tutorials, or building tech tools that simplify life.</p>

                <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
                <p>When I’m not coding or building web projects, I’m immersed in tech communities, attending events, and learning about the latest trends. I also enjoy creating motivational content, especially for those navigating careers in tech. Oh, and I have a creative side—I love designing with CSS animations, experimenting with gradients, and occasionally diving into storytelling on my YouTube channel.</p>
